# Handbook ðŸ“š

## Prerequisite
If you are reading this, you are probably familiar with some Object Oriented Programming. In order to participate in a team and have a sufficient development process, team-members should have a shared philosophy of how they develop software.


For this handbook you will need to know the SOLID principles:
- `S`ingle-Responsibility
- `O`pen/Close
- `L`iskov Substitution Principle
- `I`nterface Segregation Principle
- `D`ependency Inversion Principle

Find your own source and notes, which can explain these principles in whatever way suiting you.

Furthermore, we strongly advise you to read the Clean Code book. This philosophy is industry standard and has been for many years, so acquiring this knowledge is a great investment. 


## Technical setup

#### Engine: `v12.16.*`
#### React-version `=<16.8`
#### AWS CLI `2`
#### npm `6.14.*`
#### amplify cli `~4.27.2`


## Design
Projects, developed by the team, should use the [Atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

### Components
 - All Components must be in a file that starts with a capital letter. (Fx: `BlueButton.tsx`)
 - `atoms` should be files that are purely styled components 
 - `molecules` are components that are small, but contain more than just styled components
 - `organisms` are more complex components that contain multiple molecules/atoms

 ### Pages
 - All pages should have a folder inside content that encapsulates page specific code.

### Project structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ backend                 # Server/service related application
... 
â”œâ”€â”€ client                  # Frontend related application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components          # Atomic design
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals             # Fx: colors.tsx, categories.json etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index               # A single entry file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/types        # Model/types/codegen-files/data classes etc.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages               # Navigable singe views which implements components (top levels) 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles              # Getting started guide
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                 # package declaration and config/env files.
â””â”€â”€ readme.md
```

 
## Code Style
Per default do not use eslint or equivilant. Hover some projects will use eslint locally or on 'Git-Commit-Time'.

 - Do not outcomment code. Use the vcs! If you commit regualraly, you can always go back and find old code.
 - Try to make the code compact. Do not have lines with one symble. Fx:
 
 ```html
//Illegal 
<a 
    href="https://www.facebook.com/fundbrickscompany/"
    rel="nofollow noopener"
> 
    <FBIcon 
        name={"facebook"}
    />
</a> 

//Legal 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/fundbrickscompany/" rel="nofollow noopener"><FBIcon name={"facebook"} /></a>

```

## Security ðŸ›¡
Never ever enclude any .env files, api keys or equvilant
